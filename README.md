# React Refactor

Task: Follow the three principles covered in today's session to refactor this app:

1. Components should have one job
2. Components and variables should be well-named: consistent, accurate, readable, precise üêü
3. Use minimal state

## Using the repo

- Run command `npm i` to install required node modules;
- Then, start the development server with command `npm run dev`.
- Refactor to improve developer experience, while maintaining the current UI/UX


## Questions to consider ahead of feedback session

- Which of the 3 principles did you prioritise for refactoring?
- The dev here has made lots of missteps, even though the code works fine; which aspect did you find most challenging to work with?
- Where is the derived state, and what did you do to fix it?
